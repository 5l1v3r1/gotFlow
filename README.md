Local Maltego transforms for extracting information from nfdump files.  

There are 4 transforms currently:  

1. Import from Folder - This returns all files (preferably nfdump ones) from a folder.  
2. Get Source IP - Extracts all the Source IP addresses from a nfdump file.  
3. Get Destination Port - Extracts the destination port based on the Source IP (what the Source IP is talking to).  
4. Get Destination IP - Extracts the destination IP based on the destination port.  
  
  
Requires nfdump to be installed on the workstation.
